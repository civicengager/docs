This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected and used by Sidewalk Labs LLC, and its respective controlled subsidiaries or affiliates (together, “Sidewalk Labs,” “we”, “our”, or “us”) when you visit our websites or use our services (including services provided on our websites and our mobile apps), or when you interact with Sidewalk Labs directly or through our contractors.

If you are a California resident, please see the “[Information for California Consumers](#information-for-california-consumers)” section below.


## Collection of Information


### Information You Provide to Us

We collect personal information that you provide directly to us, including through our websites and services or when you contact us with respect to our programs or initiatives. This may include your name, email address, phone number, other contact information, online profile, demographic information, your opinions and preferences, resume and other job application information, and any other information you choose to provide.


### Information We Collect Automatically

When you use our websites and services, we may automatically collect information including personal information, such as:


* **Log Information**: We collect log information about your use of our websites, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to our websites.

* **Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**: We use various technologies to collect information, including cookies and web beacons. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us improve our websites and your experience, see which areas and features of our websites are popular and count visits. Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our websites or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits and understand usage and campaign effectiveness.


### Information Collected by Our Contractors

We use contractors to provide us with services. When contractors are collecting personal information on behalf of Sidewalk, we put in place additional measures to limit the personal information provided by the contractor to Sidewalk Labs. For example, we may hire a survey company to carry out surveys on our behalf, and instruct the contractor to only provide us with aggregate, non-identifying information.


### Analytics Services Provided by Others

In connection with the use of our websites and services, we may allow others to provide analytics services, such as Google Analytics. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information about your use of our websites and services and other websites and online services, including your IP address, web browser, device, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand your online activity.

## Information for California Consumers

This section provides additional disclosures required by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).

In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information: identifiers (such as name and contact information), professional or employment-related information and education history (such as from resumes for job applications), demographic information (such as the number of people in your household), internet or other electronic network activity information (such as browsing behavior), and other personal information (such as opinions, preferences and profile information). For more details about the personal information we collect, including the categories of sources, please see the “[Collection of Information](#collection-of-information)” section above. We collect this information for the business and commercial purposes described in the “[Use of Information](#use-of-information)” section above.  We share this information with the categories of third parties described in the “[Sharing of Information](#sharing-of-information)” section above.

Subject to certain limitations, the CCPA provides California consumers the right to request to know more details about the categories and specific pieces of personal information, to delete their personal information, to opt out of any “sales” that may be occurring, and to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights.

We do not “sell” the personal information we collect (and will not sell it in the future without providing a right to opt out).

California consumers may make a rights request by contacting us at [privacy@sidewalklabs.com](mailto:privacy@sidewalklabs.com). We will verify your request by asking you to provide information that matches information we have on file about you. Consumers can also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on their behalf, but we will require proof that the person is authorized to act on your behalf and may also still ask you to verify your identity with us directly.
